WARNING: Heatmap generation will consume alot of processor time.  Please be sure to plan accordingly!
300k kills on one map will take ~10min to generate on one 2.4Ghz core processor.

Install:
	- change user, password, database and path to your "web" folder in config.inc.php
	- download the appropriate heatmap pack from the dev branch /extras/HeatmapPack/  and put into "src"

To generate heatmaps:

To batch resize files to jpgs (useful for dds files in resource/overviews), install the .scm into the GIMP scripts dir and execute `gimp -i -b '(resize "path/to/resource/overviews/filename.dds" "filename.jpg")' -b '(gimp-quit 0)'`

The xoffset value is calculated by: `xoffset = 128 * scale - pos_x`
